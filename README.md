# Worldwide-UPI-Users-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard Creation Using Power BI)
This Power BI dashboard visualizes global UPI user data with interactive charts and KPIs. It highlights country-wise adoption, and regional comparisons, helping users quickly analyze digital payment expansion and make data-driven decisions.
# Introduction
Digital payments in India and across the world have grown rapidly, driven by increased smartphone usage, improved internet access, and the adoption of UPI (Unified Payments Interface). As users continue to shift from cash-based transactions to digital platforms, understanding their behaviour, demographics, preferences, and transaction patterns becomes essential for businesses, financial institutions, and policymakers.

This project focuses on analysing a comprehensive dataset consisting of 1,000 UPI users, covering detailed information about each user’s demographic profile, device usage, preferred payment application, transaction behaviour, and KYC status. The dataset includes attributes such as age group, country, device type, number of transactions, total transaction amount, average transaction value, language preference, and more. These features help in forming a complete picture of the user journey in the digital payment ecosystem.

To convert raw data into meaningful insights, a Power BI interactive dashboard has been developed. The PBIX report contains data modelling, cleaning, visualisation, and analytical elements that allow users to explore patterns, identify key trends, and compare behaviour across different user segments. Using slicers, KPIs, charts, and filters, the dashboard enables quick decision-making and supports deeper understanding of digital payment usage.

# 📊 Analysis Section

## Demographic Analysis
### a. Age Group Distribution

•	The 25–34 age group appears as the most dominant segment, indicating that young adults are the leading contributors to UPI activity.

•	Older age groups have significantly lower participation, showing limited adoption among senior users.
### b. Gender Distribution

•	The majority of users fall under the Male category.

•	A moderate number of Female users are present.

•	A smaller proportion is categorized as Other, reflecting inclusivity in digital transactions.
### c. Country-wise Users
•	India contributes the largest share, showing that UPI usage is primarily India-centric, as expected.

•	Users from other countries indicate international adoption of UPI-linked apps or NRIs using UPI services.

## Device Usage Analysis
•	Android is the most widely used device, showing strong penetration of UPI apps on Android phones.

•	iOS holds a moderate share, while Windows devices are the least used.

## App Usage Analysis
•	PhonePe emerges as the most preferred UPI app among users.

•	Google Pay is also widely used and appears as a close competitor.

•	Amazon Pay and other apps show lower adoption but still serve a segment of users.

## User Type Analysis
The dataset classifies users as:

•	Individual Users

•	Merchant Users

Findings:

•	A significant portion of users are Individuals, indicating normal day-to-day use cases like bill payments, recharges, and personal transfers.

•	Merchants also form a meaningful part of the dataset, showing the use of UPI for retail payments and business transactions.

## Transaction Behaviour Analysis
### a. Transaction Count
•	There is a wide variation in transaction frequency among users.

•	Some users perform high transaction counts, indicating heavy app engagement.

•	Others have low counts, pointing to occasional or new users.
### b. Total Transaction Amount
•	High-value users are easily identifiable through their large total transaction amounts.

•	Some merchants contribute significantly, confirming the role of UPI in business payments.
### c. Average Transaction Value
•	Users with very high average transaction values indicate large transfers with fewer transactions.

•	Users with low average amounts but high transaction counts may be using UPI for everyday small-value payments.

## KYC Status Analysis
•	Verified KYC users are the majority, suggesting compliance and stable accounts.

•	Pending KYC users indicate incomplete onboarding or new accounts.

•	Rejected KYC users highlight issues in verification, potentially affecting their transaction limits or app usage.

##  Language Preference Analysis
•	Language preference reflects regional diversity in digital payments.

•	Tamil, Marathi, and Hindi appear among the common preferences, aligning with UPI’s regional adoption patterns.
